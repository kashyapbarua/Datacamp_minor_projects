Simpson's Paradox
- On an overall basis, males are more likely to be admitted.
- But within most departments, females are more likely to be admitted.
- When controlling for department, relationship between gender and admission status is reversed and this is called the Simpson's Paradox.
Potential Reason
- Women tended to apply to competitive departments with low admission rates.
- Men tended to apply to less competitive departments with high admission rates.
